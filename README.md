This Project shows what heppens to a string if you try to reverse it in different abtractions like bytes, chars and StringBuilder. The result is different if your string contains surrogates or not. See comments in source code for more hints.

The text files are stored in {user.home}/StringExp. Use as hex editor for analysing the bytes.
